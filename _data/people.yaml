  expertise: Airborne Wind Energy
  motivation: 'I have worked for many years in the field of computational fluid dynamics, where good code and data management is crucial, and where sharing of data (for example, for benchmarking different solvers) has a long tradition. In my view, data sharing is an important extension of the concept of scientific peer review, enabling peers to retrace analyses and build on them. Without having access to the original data and source code this is generally very difficult or not possible at all. In my recent work on airborne wind energy, an emerging renewable energy technology, I have also learned that the quality of the data has a large impact on its reusability. We scientists tend to focus on the things that are of highest interest at the moment when we conduct an experiment or a computational simulation. We often neglect to record or store data that is not of immediate interest but that can potentially become interesting or very important later. I have realized this, for example, when working on a project supported by the Data Refinement Fund of the 4TU Centre for Research Data. In this project we assembled the data recordings and associated photo and video footage of five years of flight testing with our pioneering 20 Kilowatt kite power system, with the objective of making this data available to the broader research community. While it was relatively straightforward to compile the original data recordings, it was a painstaking detective work and not always possible to retrace and properly identify data that was not recorded but only written down in log files, or documented by the photo and video footage. However, it was important for anyone who wants to reuse the data. A good data management strategy would have helped address these issues. But luckily we have learned from these experiences.

Proactive sharing of high quality research data is an important ingredient of an efficient networked R&D road map. Especially for emerging technologies a good management & sharing strategy can really make a difference and contribute to a rapid advancement of the research agenda. For example, data sharing can enable researchers of different research teams to cross-validate their modeling frameworks and thus more rapidly improve the quality of the models. I am convinced that industry will ultimately benefit from such high quality modeling tools. From 2015 until 2018 I have coordinated the EU Horizon 2020 doctoral training network AWESCO, with a total of 16 PhD researchers at 12 European partner institutions, and as part of this project we had to develop, step-by-step a data management and sharing strategy. Since the project included not only academic partners but also industry, the sharing aspect especially was not an easy task. But we managed and successfully concluded the project with several collaborative research streams that produced and still continue to produce important results for the commercial development teams. As a data champion I would like to share my experiences with my fellow researchers.'

Alessandra-Menicucci:
  name: Alessandra Menicucci
  faculty: Faculty of Aerospace Engineering
  position: Assistant Professor
  department: Space Systems Engineering
  motivation: 'My research has been since the very beginning centered around data analysis, in particular the search for rare decays in particle physics or signature of dark matter in cosmic rays spectra. I believe that data management and sharing is of paramount importance not only for scientific discoveries, but also for improving the quality and efficiency of our daily work as engineers and researchers. Space industry is traditionally very conservative and reluctant to data openness: spacecraft design and test data are kept behind closed doors very rarely made available to the community. In order to face the challenges that space exploration presents to us, we need to modify this attitude and I believe that a new generation of space engineers formed with a solid understanding of big data management can make this change possible.'
  expertise: Micro-spacecraft system engineering, space instrumentation (radiation and space environment monitors, asteroid muography), space environment and effects analysis, space embedded systems.

    motivation: 'The main reason is that I firmly believe in open science: sharing data, source code, and even hardware designs, allows others to reproduce your scientific experiments and findings with much less effort. Other researchers can then easily compare their work with yours, or build upon your work, so that together we can make much quicker progress. As a side-effect, it increases the impact of your work, both in terms of scientific citations and in terms of use by industry. Finally, providing open access to data and source code forces you to put in an additional effort in making it comprehensible and easy to use. This is not only useful to others, but also to yourself when you have to reuse it at a later date.'

    faculty: Applied Sciences
    position: Associate Professor
    department: Imaging Physics
    motivation: 'In microscopy, we generate many images that help us draw conclusions we present in papers, but that can also contain data that is interesting for others, including researchers that do not have access to the high end machines we use. Often, a user-selected snapshot makes it into the paper while the context of the full datasets is lost. Making these full datasets publicly available can thus accelerate science, as they can be used by a wider group of scientists including those in places or countries where equipment is not available. Also, open data can be very useful for educational purposes, I am also using online biomedical data that we cannot generate here in Delft in one of my courses. I would like to share experiences with others and see what we can learn from each other. We are generating very big datasets that present a lot of challenges for making it publicly available, both in size, but also, e.g. metadata. Others can learn from what we are doing, and I would like to learn from the approaches others have been taking. I would also like to discuss questions like what data (raw, annotated, analyzed) should be made public? How should one be credited if someone else uses the data?I would also like to discuss examples of how we use open data in our lectures and assignments for students.'

Henriette-Bier:
    name: Henriette Bier
    faculty: Architecture and the Built Environment
    position: Associate Professor
    motivation: 'In the field of computational design and robotics in architecture, good code and data management are crucial and sharing of data for advancing ideas is necessary. Data sharing is also an important tool for scientific peer review, enabling peers to retrace analyses and eventually build on them. Without having access to the original data and source code this is generally very difficult or not possible. Furthermore, the quality of the data has a big impact on reusability. Assembling data recordings and associated photos and videos of the design to robotic production system, with the objective of making this data available to the broader research community is main motivation for data management and sharing. </p> <p class="bodytext">Proactive sharing of high-quality research data is an important aspect of a networked R&amp;D approach. Especially for emerging technologies, a good management and sharing strategy can really make a difference and contribute to a rapid advancement of the research. For example, data sharing can enable researchers of different research teams to cross-validate their modeling frameworks and thus more rapidly improve the quality of the models. The industry will also benefit from high-quality models. As a data champion I would like to share my experiences with fellow researchers and potential R&amp;D contributors.'

  expertise: Social network data analysis, Machine learning, Anomaly detection, Natural language processing, Digital data collection, Python
  motivation: 'I believe one of the most important yet missing pieces in the current research landscape is data management. It facilitates and accelerates the research cycle by making the research activities findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). Despite the significance of FAIR research, making a large university (with thousands of scholars and lots of ongoing research projects) fully FAIR at once might seem infeasible. That is why the role of data champion matters. They can smoothly bridge this gap by promoting data management practises among their colleagues. Besides the raising awareness, being a data champion provides the opportunity of learning about other or most recent data management techniques and practices. From a personal point of view, I am also very much interested in circulating data management tips among computational social scientists due to the recent tendency of both social scientists and scholars from hard disciplines to work on multidisciplinary projects.'

With the growing cost of data acquisition and annotation in many fields, good data sharing and management platforms are becoming precious resources. Therefore, free and open access to such resources collectively improves the success, strength, reach and impact of all research.

Hugo-Verhelst:
  name: Hugo Verhelst
  position: PhD candidate
  faculty: Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science
  department: Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics
  expertise: Computational Mechanics; Structural Analysis; Finite Element Methods; Isogeometric Analysis
  motivation: I strongly believe in open science and in my domain the open-source codes are very important. In academia, open-source code seems to be quite established, but in industry that is not always the case. I hope that we, as an educational institution for engineers, can show students the power of open-source software, and that we can also provide them the skills and knowledge to work with these powerful tools.

  department: Materials, Mechanics, Management & Design (3MD)
  expertise: Construction materials, Earthen construction, Alternative building materials, Biomaterials, Biopolymers, Geotechnical engineering
  motivation: I have been a promoter of open science, and I believe in true open access, which is not only the free availability of science (that can be easily executed through sharing research via library or websites such as research gate) but also its understandability! I am a critique of commercial open access that is an extremely profitable business model for publishers and inherently partial to independent researchers and authors of middle-income countries. I am interested in alternative platforms of science communication, and I would like to learn more about them. In my current research work, I am exploring video communication as a platform to directly disseminate the knowledge generated from my research to its target users.
